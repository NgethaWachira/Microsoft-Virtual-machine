## Steps
- Create a Resource Group: All resources in Azure must be in a resource group, which acts as a container for organizing and managing those resources - 
it allows us to group related resources together for easier management, access control, and deployment e.g virtual machines. 
Next we create a new Virtual Machine; Choose the Azure subscription you want to use for the VM and the existing resource group that we created.

</p>

- To connect to the VM, we get the Public IP Address of the VM, Select the VM you want to connect to and under the "Overview" tab, find the Public IP address.
  Ensure RDP Port (3389) is Open in the Network Security Group (NSG). This allows us to access the VM remotely. Next we download and Open the Remote Desktop Client,
  Enter the Public IP Address, provide the credentials,that is; the username and password that you created during the VM setup. Click Connect, the RDP client will
  establish a remote desktop session to your VM, and youâ€™ll see the Windows desktop of the VM.

</p>

- Next we enroll a device into Intune which involves installing the Company Portal app from the Microsoft Store, which facilitates the enrollment process.
  Before enrolling the VM into Intune, we first confirm that the VM is registered with Azure Active Directory(Azure AD) because Intune uses Azure AD for
  device management. Since our VM is not yet registered, we go to Settings > Accounts > Access work or school > Add a work or school account. Select Work or
  school account, then enter the credentials associated with our Azure AD account.

</p>

- We manually onboarded our device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using a PowerShell script. We download the Onboarding Package from Microsoft 365
  Defender portal, download and run the onboarding script using powerShell as an Administrator. The script will install the necessary sensors and
  configurations for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

</p>

- We can verify the status of the device to see if the onboarding was successful, Go to EndPoints > Device Inventory and ensure that all devices are
  showing up in the list with a status of "Onboarded". Once our machine is onboarded, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will begin providing protection by
  monitoring for threats, alerts, vulnerabilities, and providing tools for incident response.

</p>

- Onboarded devices may take some time for the service to become fully functional. For our case we are using Defender for Endpoint P1 (Plan 1) which can
  take 5-6 hours for devices to become fully protected as the device completes its onboarding and synchronization process and report into the Microsoft
  365 Defender portal.

</p>

- Next we create a new Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Policy in Microsoft Intune to manage and secure endpoints is an effective way to reduce the risk of
  attacks by controlling which applications and behaviors are allowed on your devices. Configure the ASR rules that are designed to reduce the attack surface.

</p>

- Once our ASR policy is configured, we'll assign it to the relevant device groups in Intune. We choose which groups or devices we want the policy to apply to.
  After assigning the policy to the desired groups, click on Create or Save to deploy the ASR policy. The policy will then be pushed out to the assigned devices, and the settings will take effect on those endpoints.
